                    <li> The Service Provider has breached an Essential Obligation (notwithstanding that it may not be the same Essential Obligation being breached each time);</li>
                   <li>  The breach or threatened breach by either Party of any of its material obligations under this Agreement;</li>
                   <li>  The Service Provider partaking in unlawful and/or fraudulent behaviour;</li>

                   <li>  The Service Provider becomes, threatens or resolves to become or is in jeopardy of becoming subject to any form of insolvency administration.</li>
            </ul>

           <p> If a Termination Event occurs, this Agreement may be terminated by notice in writing by Wellbe to the Service Provider, with effect immediately. Either Party may terminate the Wellbe Service Provider account and this Agreement at any time for any reason.,/p>
           <p> Upon termination of this Agreement, the Service Provider must;</p>
           <ul>
                <li>Stop performing the Services and inform Wellbe of any Bookings not yet performed so that Wellbe can make alternative arrangements for the performance of such Bookings;</li>

               <li> Cease all use of the Platform;</li>

           </ul>

            <p>The Service Provider acknowledges and agrees that if the Service Provider does not pay or repay any sums lawfully owing to the Customer or to Wellbe, Wellbe will be entitled to deduct those sums from any amount payable to the Service Provider.</p>

           <p> Wellbe must pay to the Service Provider any Service Fees which have been received by Wellbe on behalf of the Service Provider and have not yet been paid to the Service Provider in respect of Bookings completed prior to the date of Termination (less any deductions which Wellbe is entitled to make pursuant to this Agreement or as otherwise agreed in writing between the parties, if relevant).</p>

            <p>Termination of this Agreement will not prejudice or impair any rights, remedies, or continuous obligations that have already accrued to any Party under or in respect of any breach of this Agreement.</p>

         <p>The Service Provider must obtain and maintain any necessary and adequate insurance(s) throughout the Term, (including public liability insurance) on terms that are satisfactory to Wellbe in Wellbe’s absolute discretion, and otherwise comply with any other legislation as applicable.</p>

         <p> The Service Provider will be obliged to produce to Wellbe, at Wellbe’s request, original documentation to confirm the validity of any and all necessary insurance policies required to be maintained by the Service Provider.</p>

                <p> The Service Provider must not:</p>
                <ul>

                </ul>


                  <p> The Service Provider agrees that:</p>
                <ul>               
                <li>Any failure to comply with the above would significantly diminish the value of Wellbe’ business; and</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The Service Provider acknowledges that monetary damages alone would not be adequate compensation to Wellbe for the Service Provider’s breach of the above and that Wellbe is entitled to seek an injunction from a court of competent jurisdiction if the Service Provider fails to comply or Wellbe has reason to believe that the Service Provider has failed to comply.</p>

                 <p>Except as expressly authorised in writing, no Party will have (and must not represent that it has) any power, right or authority to bind the other Party, or to assume or create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on behalf of the other or in the other’s name.</p>

            <h4>LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY </h4>
        </div>
            <div class=" sec-head4">
               <p> The Service Provider acknowledges and agrees that it is responsible for any losses, costs, expenses, and damages to Wellbe or any third party in respect of, arising out of or in connection with the Services that the Service Provider provides, or negligence or any breach of this Agreement by the Service Provider.</p>

                <p>The Service Provider hereby indemnifies and undertakes to keep Wellbe indemnified from and against all and any Losses suffered or incurred by Wellbe in connection with this Agreement.</p>

                <p>The Service Provider acknowledges that the indemnity applies to Losses arising from:</p>
                <ul>
                
                    <li>The negligence of any Party or third party;</li>
                    <li>The manner in which the Services are performed by the Service Provider, including but not limited to any act or omission by the Service Provider in connection with the performance of the Services;</li>
                    <li>The decision of any court, tribunal, or other authority in respect of the classification of the Service Provider as either an employee or contractor under common law or statute;</li>
                   <li> Any taxes, fees, charges, and any other imposts.

                </li>
                </ul>

                    <p>The indemnity is a continuing obligation which is separate and independent from any other obligations of the parties under this Agreement and it survives termination or expiry of this Agreement. The Service Provider acknowledges and agrees that it is not necessary for Wellbe to incur any expense or cost or make any payment before enforcing the indemnity and the Service Provider must pay any money due to Wellbe under that indemnity on demand by Wellbe.</p>

                     <p>Wellbe does not warrant that the Platform will be uninterrupted or error-free and the Service Provider agrees that Wellbe will not be liable to the Service Provider for any loss or damage, including loss of profit arising from any malfunction or bugs in respect of the Platform.</p>

                   <p> To the maximum extent permitted by law, Wellbe will not accept liability to the Service Provider in respect of any loss or damage (including indirect, special, or consequential loss or damage) which may be suffered or incurred by the Service Provider or which may arise directly or indirectly in respect of the Service Provider using the Platform.</p>

                   <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, any condition or warranty by Wellbe which would otherwise be implied into this Agreement is hereby excluded.</p>

                   <p>The obligations under will survive termination or expiry of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement limits or affects any agreement between the Service Provider and the Customer as to liability for loss and damage to the Property or loss to the Customer arising from the Services provided by the Service Provider.</p>

                <h4>DISPUTE RESOLUTION </h4>
            </div>
            <div class=" sec-head4">
             
                 <p>In the event of a Dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Parties agree to the following dispute resolution procedure:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Complainant must provide a Dispute Notice to the Respondent; 
                        <li>Upon receipt of a Dispute Notice by the Respondent, the Parties will arrange to meet in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute amicably by agreement between them; </li>
                        <li>If the parties cannot resolve the Dispute within two (2) weeks of the Dispute Notice having been received by the Respondent, either party may refer the matter to a mediator. The Parties must attend the mediation recommended by the mediator, in good faith, to seek to resolve the Dispute through mediation.</li>
                        <li>Each Party will bear their own legal costs in any Dispute. The cost of a mediator appointed will be shared equally between each Party. </li> 
                        <li>Any attempts made by the Parties to resolve a Dispute pursuant to this clause will be without prejudice to any other rights or entitlements of the parties under this Agreement, by law or in equity. </li> 
                    </ul>

                    <p>For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this clause prejudices the right of either party to seek urgent injunctive, interlocutory or declaratory relief from a court in connection with the Dispute without first having to attempt to resolve the Dispute.</p>
