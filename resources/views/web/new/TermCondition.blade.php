            <h4 > OUR SERVICES </h4>
            <br>
            <p> Wellbe provides a booking and purchase service (the Services). The Services allow you to book a range of Professional services (Professional Services) that are performed in each and every case by independent self-employed professionals (Service Providers). In providing the Services, Wellbe acts as the agent of the Service Providers. Wellbe has no responsibility for any Professional Services which you book or purchase through us: we are simply involved with the booking and/or purchase process, as well as providing ancillary services (including an online booking service) as explained below. </p>
            <br>
            <p> The Services we offer allow you to search through Our Site and purchase Professional Services from a number of Service Providers. In enabling you to purchase Professional Services, we are acting as the commercial agent of those Service Providers. As part of the Services, we also provide some ancillary services such as assisting with customer service issues (again in our capacity as agent for the Service Providers). </p>
            <br>
            <p> However, as stated above, the contract for the purchase of the Professional Services is between you and the Service Provider. This means that it is the Service Provider (not us) who is legally responsible for providing the Professional Service. However, Wellbe remains responsible in respect of its obligations to you in accordance with Our Terms which shall be legally binding. If you have any questions, complaints or requests for refunds, we can be contacted directly at info@wellbe.co.nz. Wellbe will remain the point of contact for you for customer service questions. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Wellbe shall, if requested, provide intermediary services between you and an Service Provider in connection with customer service or dispute resolution matters. </p>
         </div>

         <div class="sec-head4">
            <h4 > BOOKING AND PURCHASE PROCESS </h4>
            <br>
            <p> You can make a booking through Our Site by choosing an Service Provider. Your payment details will be requested at the time of booking and payment will be collected when you make a booking. Full payment of the service is due at the time of booking with the Service Provider through us. Full details of the prices are referred to below. The Treatment Fee belongs to the Service Provider who provides the Professional Service. Wellbe, as the Service Provider's agent, collects or arranges for a third party to collect on our behalf, the Treatment Fee from you. Our receipt of the full Treatment Fee will discharge your debt to the relevant Service Provider in respect of that booking. We are appointed by Service Providers to conclude bookings on their behalf as their commercial agent. Once your booking is accepted by us on behalf of the and the Service Provider, you will receive confirmation of your appointment from us by email. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Wellbe shall, if requested, provide intermediary services between you and an Service Provider in connection with customer service or dispute resolution matters. </p>
            <br>
            <p> By making a booking, you are responsible for: </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
               <li> Full payment of the applicable Treatment Fee; </li>
               <li> Ensuring the Service Provider has access to your Designated Premises which must, in all cases, represent a suitable space in which the Professional Service can be performed, with all appropriate facilities (including adequate lighting and heating); and </li>
               <li> Ensuring the health and safety of the Service Provider whilst at your Designated Premises. </li>
               <li> Ensuring that you can provide a valid Covid 19 vaccination passport. </li>
            </ul>
         </div>

         <div class="sec-head4">
            <h4 > YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES </h4>
            <br>
            <p> In addition to the responsibilities noted above, it is your responsibility to provide complete and accurate information at the time of booking or purchase. Failure to provide complete and accurate information (including confirmation of a Covid 19 vaccination certificate) may result in a rejection of your booking request, cancellation of your booking, an inability of the booked Service Provider to provide the Professional Service as requested. Such failure may lead to your payments being ineligible for refund, or a loss or incorrect delivery of your booking or Order Confirmation. In such cases where there has been a failure on your part to provide us with accurate information, our cancellation and refund policy will apply. </p>
         </div>

         <div class="sec-head4">
            <h4 > PAYMENT </h4>

We will do all that we reasonably can to ensure that all of the information you give us when paying for the Professional Service is secure by using an encrypted secure payment mechanism. However, in the absence of negligence on the part of Wellbe, we will not be legally responsible to you for any loss that you may suffer if a third party gains unauthorised access to any information that you may give us at any time. </p>
            <br>
            <p> All payments by credit card or debit card need to be authorised by the relevant card issuer. We may also need to use extra security steps via Verified by Visa where applicable.

            <br>
            <p> All fees and charges are exclusive of GST where applicable or unless specified otherwise. </p>
         </div>

            <br>
            <p> Confirmed bookings cannot be rescheduled; you must cancel the confirmed booking (fees may apply, see below) and create a new booking to change the time or date. Learn how to <a href="">cancel a booking.</a> </p>
         </div>

         <div class="sec-head4">
            <h4 > Booker Cancellations: </h4>
            <br>
            <ul>
               <li> If you self-cancel your booking more than 24 hours before the scheduled start time, you will be refunded 100% of the booking amount. </li>

            </ul>
         </div>

         <div class="sec-head4">
            <h4 > Practitioner Cancellations: </h4>
            <br>
            <ul>
               <li> If your practitioner is unable to make your booking for any reason (e.g. an emergency or car trouble), you will be refunded 100% of the booking amount. </li>
               <li> You will receive an email notification if your practitioner cancels your booking. </li>
            </ul>
               <br>
               <p> If you are due a refund for a booking, it will be paid to you within 72 hours of the cancellation date. </p>
               <br>
               <p> You will not be refunded if you: </p>
               <br>
               <ul>
                  <li> Attempt to cancel a booking on or after the treatment start time; or </li>
                  <li> Fail to attend a booking at the treatment start time and/or at the designated premises. </li>
                  <li> Fail to provide accurate information for your Service Provider to attend the designated premises </li>
                  <li> Fail to provide accurate and complete contact details or personal information such as but not limited to full name phone number and address </li>

                  <li> Have had inappropriate behaviour reported, which ends the treatment early. </li>
               </ul>
               <p> A cancellation fee is charged in order to compensate the Service Provider because it is not reasonable to expect the Service Provider to be able to provide a Professional Service at another booking where you cancel with short or no notice. </p>
               <br>
               <p> Cancellation fees may in our absolute discretion be waived where you have been unable to cancel a booking without incurring the cancellation fee for genuine reasons which were outside of your control. Where cancellation fees are waived by us, we act as agent of the Service Provider who is the principal in supplying the Professional Service. </p>

         <div class="sec-head4">
            <h4> EXTENSIONS AND DELAYS </h4>
            <br>
            <p> If you wish to extend the time you have booked a Professional Service, the Service Provider will endeavour to fulfil your request. This is subject to the availability of the Service Provider and payment of an additional charge. </p>
            <br>
            <p> If you are delayed and unable to start the Professional Service at the Designated Premises at the Appointment Time by more than 10 minutes then, unless the Service Provider agrees to the contrary (which is within the sole discretion of the Service Provider) the Service Provider is entitled to end the Professional Service at the time agreed when the booking was made without making any adjustment to the Treatment Price to reflect the reduced time of the Professional Service.  </p>

            <h4> WELLBE ACTS ONLY AS AN INTRODUCER </h4>
